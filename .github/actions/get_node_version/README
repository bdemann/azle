## Prerequisite

This action assumes that the repository has been checked out before calling the action, typically using `actions/checkout@v4`. If you haven't checked out the code in a previous step, make sure to do so to avoid errors.

Example usage:

```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - id: get-node-version
      uses: ./.github/actions/get_node_version
```

## Output

The output of this action contains the Node.js version that Azle uses. It can be obtained as follows:

```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - id: get-node-version
      uses: ./.github/actions/get_node_version

    - run: echo ${{ steps.get-node-version.outputs.node-version }}
```
