# HTTP Server (Experimental)

This section documents the HTTP Server methodology for developing Azle applications. This methodology embraces traditional web server techniques, allowing you to write HTTP servers using popular libraries such as Express, and using JSON for simple serialization and deserialization purposes.

HTTP Server functionality will remain experimental for an unknown length of time.
