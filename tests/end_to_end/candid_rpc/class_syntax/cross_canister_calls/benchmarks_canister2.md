**Note on calculations:**

-   Cycles are calculated using the formula: base_fee + (per_instruction_fee \* number_of_instructions)
-   Base fee: 590,000 cycles
-   Per instruction fee: 0.4 cycles
-   USD value is derived from the total cycles, where 1 trillion cycles = 1 XDR, and 1 XDR = $1.336610 (as of December 18, 2023)
